# Viscek-s-Implementation
Viscek's model is a mathematical model used to study the collective behavior of self-propelled particles in a 2D space, essentially imitating flocking or swarm behavior . 

The model assumes that each particle has a fixed speed and can change its direction by a small random amount at each time step. The particles interact with their neighboring particles within a certain range and align their velocities with the average velocity of their neighbors. 

The simulation consists of 100 and 500 particles (or agents) and aims to investigate the collective behavior of the particles under different conditions.

500 particles




The code is implemented in a programming language and contains detailed comments to aid in understanding the logic and functionality of the simulation. The simulation involves initializing the positions and velocities of the particles randomly in the 2D space and updating the direction of each particle's velocity to align it with the average velocity of its neighbors within a certain range.

The code is structured and well-documented to facilitate ease of use, modification, and extension. The simulation parameters can be adjusted to investigate the effect of different parameters on the collective behavior of the particles. This simulation can be used to study phenomena in various fields such as physics, biology, and social sciences, where collective behavior is observed.
