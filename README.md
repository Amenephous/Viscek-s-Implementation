# Viscek-s-Implementation
Viscek's model is a mathematical model used to study the collective behavior of self-propelled particles in a 2D space, essentially imitating flocking or swarm behavior . 

The model assumes that each particle has a fixed speed and can change its direction by a small random amount at each time step. The particles interact with their neighboring particles within a certain range and align their velocities with the average velocity of their neighbors.
